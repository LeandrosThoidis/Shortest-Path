# EDULEARN24 – Smart Campus Navigation 

**EDULEARN24** is a web-based pedestrian navigation system built for the **University of Patras**. It calculates the most efficient walking routes across the campus using advanced pathfinding algorithms like **Dijkstra’s** and **A\***, with real-time routing support from the **GraphHopper Directions API**.

## 📌 Features

- 🚶 **Optimized Campus Routing**  
  Calculates the shortest walking paths between any two campus locations.

- 🧠 **Algorithms Implemented**  
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm  
  - A* (A-star) Search Algorithm

- 🌍 **GraphHopper API Integration**  
  Utilizes GraphHopper's open-source routing engine for map data and real-world navigation support.

- 💻 **Web-Based Interface**  
  Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

- 📄 **Detailed Technical Documentation**  
  Written and formatted in **LaTeX** for clarity and professional presentation.
